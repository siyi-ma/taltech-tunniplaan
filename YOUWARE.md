# TalTech Course Schedule System

## Project Overview
This is a TalTech course schedule viewer that displays course sessions with filtering and search capabilities. The system was originally designed for course catalogs but has been adapted to work with schedule data.

## Data Structure
The application expects course session data in `courses.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
  "keel": "Eesti keel",
  "tyyp": "loeng+harjutus", 
  "oppejoud": "Viktor Rjabt≈°ikov(lektor)",
  "oppenadalad": "1",
  "ryhmad": "EDJR54_V,EDJR55_V",
  "ainekavaurl": "https://ois2.taltech.ee/uusois/aine/EVR0230",
  "tpg": "EDJR55_V",
  "date": "06.09.2025",
  "ainekood": "EVR0230", 
  "aine": "MATLAB ja numbrilised meetodid",
  "start": "13:00",
  "end": "16:15",
  "ruum": "VK1-25" // optional
}
```

## Customization Notes
- The filter system has been adapted from course catalog filters to schedule-specific filters
- Course type filter uses the original "school" filter dropdown

- Instructor filter uses the original "assessment form" filter dropdown
- EAP filtering has been removed as it doesn't apply to schedule data

## JavaScript Architecture

- Debounced search input for performance
- Dynamic filter population based on data
- Responsive expand/collapse functionality for course details

## Styling
- Uses TalTech brand colors (dark blue, magenta, light blue)
